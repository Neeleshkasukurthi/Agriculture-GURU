  Abstract - With the growing global crises of food and hunger is rising day by day and there are not many people who are thinking regarding the topic. The consumption rate is increasing day by day but the production rate is only drastically falling rather than increasing. With the surveys done in recent years, the world might see global food crises by 2050. The main contribution presented in the paper is one insignificant step towards the future by accepting the information about the farming process from the farmers to help them. We accept the information provided about their crop along with the information of the other farmers in their locality and we analyse all the information provided by farmers in their locality for the starting first year and then we provide them with the best possible farming process year after year to bring the best for them and the society. Towards a better future together.
Key Words: Data analysis, Database Administration, Agriculture, Visual/Graphical representation, Farmer.
1. INTRODUCTION
This Project mainly focuses on the features of suggesting the best possible outcome for the Farmer, We gather the information that a farmer is using throughout the Agriculture process as when did he/she start: which Month, Which date he/she is updating the information, What kind of crop is being sown, and we also take the inputs like which type of pesticide he/she is using for the crop to be protected, we also the input as to where he/she belongs to as which Country, city. We take the input of the total expense of the Agriculture process from the very first step till the harvest, we then take the selling price like for much did he earn for the whole crop he/she harvested. We then calculate the profit or loss for his/her crop. We then store all of it in a database, and for one year we keep track of the farmer not only him/her but all the farmers for at least a year. We then prompt them with the message on the system providing them with the earlier Agriculture that they did at the same time previous year and we will also give them a suggestion about who was the one among the other farmers who got the highest profit in their locality. Along with the top, we will also suggest what he did across his/her Agriculture process and what were the things he used for the success he/she got. We will provide all the information locality wise for better reach for each other as farmers in the same locality can reach out to each other and have chat on how he/she got the success, Even we cannot provide all the information of his/her because privacy policies concern. But they all can
have chat to have a better understanding of the process he/she undergone to get the profit.
1.1 Motivation
We are Losing 25,000 to Hunger Every Day. Around 9 million individuals pass on each extended time of endlessly hunger- related diseases. This is more than from AIDS, intestinal sickness and tuberculosis joined. A child dies from hunger every 10 seconds, and 1 in 9 people go to bed hungry, We will suffer a global crisis of food scarcity by 2050, Not everyone can afford to keep food in the refrigerator but if we work today we can change the tomorrow. We have seen that there are a lot of hunger deaths in the world and when we backtracked we found that hunger deaths are caused because of food scarcity and food scarcity is there because of lees production and less production is because farmers are not doing farming and it is because they have less profit and it is because they are getting less profit and to boost it we made this project.
1.2 Existing System
In the existing system, all farmers work hard but not much smartly, they work the existing systems by sowing only one kind of cops year after year with only a few changes in the techniques. As sowing only particular type in the part of the year even if there may be some other that can work for them. Currently, many of the frames are using very old but not many effective methods. The existing system also gives limited information when there are a lot more to process from the field they farm on and can be changed by a few basic factors to bring out the best.
1.3 Need for New System
Currently, farmers need some guidance regarding what they need at what time and how are they going to fetch the required details for the maximum profit for the harvest that they will get at the end. They need guidance about what they can change in their farming style for better outputs for their effort. We cannot guarantee a 100% Success rate but we rather can say we can boost some amount of output that is generated. The Crops are sorted and selected based on the top rankings by the user who is suitable for the nature of the locality for the harvest.

2. Objective
Our project is an application that acts as an Agriculture Guide giving out outputs to the user for every input given to the system. This System tries the user to give a heads-up giving them the best-suited profit-making harvest. The User has options to select for the places he/she wants to do Agriculture for instance Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and so on; the system will ask whether he is looking for the current region or another spot. We will provide them with information about the top performer's locality wise. The system is a Web Application that will act as an Agriculture Guide that will suggest users for every point by taking any input to the system thus the name “Agriculture GURU”. This System tries to give the user suggestion on the profitable crops for the season or period. The system is used to help a Farmer with a new Agriculture approach towards better profit earning for them. This is done by suggesting the best profit earner in their locality. The Crops are sorted and selected based on the top rankings by the user. The User has options to select for the places he/she wants to do Agriculture for instance Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and so on; the system will ask whether he is searching for the current locality.



The proposed system acts by accepting the information about the farming process from the farmers to help them. We accept the information provided about their crop along with the information of the other farmers in their locality and we analyse all the information provided by farmers in their locality for the starting first year and then we provide them with the best possible farming process year after year to bring the best for them and the society. Along The information provided by the user after logging in is displayed and give access to edit or delete them. They get the live count of how many users are present from which nationality and also can find how much was their expense for each kind of crop they have registered for.

CONCLUSION
We want to make sure every farmer gets the highest that he can and let them be a part in sustaining the food scarcity.
